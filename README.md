# DappCamp Warriors

## Frontend

This is the the frontend for our [DappCamp Warriors](https://github.com/DappCamp-Cohort-4/dappcamp-warriors) Dapp. It is built with Next.js and ethers.js.

## Step 4: Add Mint NFT form

- In this step, we add a form to the "Mint" page. This form will only be visible to the owner of the contract. The owner will be able to mint a new NFT to a particular address using the form.
- The mint button makes call to the Warriors contract.
